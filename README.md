# CPP MODULES

## Summary

This repository contains the modules of the C++ piscine from 42 School.

Each module is in a folder named `cppXX` where `XX` is the number of the module.

The higher the number, the more advanced the module is.

In all of these exercises, I have adhered to good coding practices, ensuring that my code is clean, readable, and efficient. All my code has been compiled using the `c++` compiler with the flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`, and it has been confirmed to compile with the `-std=c++98` flag as well.

## Module 01 - Memory Allocation and References

The objective of this module was to gain a deep understanding of memory allocation, pointers to members, references, and the switch instruction in C++.

The exercises allowed me to enhance my skills in the following areas:

- **Memory Allocation:** Learned how to dynamically allocate memory for program variables during runtime using the new operator for initialization and the delete operator for de-allocation.
- **Pointers on members:** Learned how to declare and assign pointers to class members and understood how to operate them.
- **References:** Understood the use of references in C++ and how they can be used as an alternative to pointers, especially in function argument lists and function return values.
- **Switch Instruction:** Gained experience in employing the switch case control structure to execute one code block among many alternatives.
- **Using C++ libraries:** Had the opportunity to explore the C++ standard library and learned to prefer C++ versions of functions over their C counterparts.
